###Purpose
This app was created as a way for people to share moments with other people in the same location and with people who would be in that same location in the future.

###Challenges

One of our main issues was the scope of our project with the amount of time available to complete it.


We originally wanted pictures and video within our app but ended up having to scrap the videos and have only pictures posted to our application.
